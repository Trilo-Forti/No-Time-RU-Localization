I, Dexter the Sodamaniac have compiled the story of  Dr. Caleb Benny Alderton the founder of the ancient
and delicious Soda perfect.

Chapter 1, the beginning.
1865 - Antillian Commonwealth young pharmacist Dr. Caleb Benny Alderton has set up shop in St. André.
His practice is often sought out however customers/ patients often come buy to taste 
his medicinal drink. During this time many pharmacists had so called soda fountains in their stores.
To serve as magnets for potential customers.

The good doctor invented a healthy soda mixture with several health tonics, and some natural flavorings.
First called “Bennies Drink,” this popular beverage was crafted with a mix of sugar, water, caramel, lemon oil, kola nuts, nutmeg, and other additives. Until finally someone said the legendary words... "this is the perfect soda!"
