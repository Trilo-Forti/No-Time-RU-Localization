Pine Island, to the northern east of Antillia. In that time there were four settlements. Cape Dun, the first to be built,
which was established by Lord Dun in the 1500s. Second was a fishing settlement, a place marked with strange ruins of many cultures from the past.
Third was Byroad, an uninteresting little place on the outskirts of Owens Desert, in the north. 
Fourth was Pine Lake, originally founded by Edwin Athor in the 18th century as a mining settlement, 
it has now begun to grow as a proper city of its own. These four settlements lived in relative peace to each other for decades.
No formal government was established until in AD 1842 Cape Dun and Pine Lake established a republic union under the still residing heir to Lord Dun,
to the disliking of the other two settlements Byroad and the fishing settlement.
