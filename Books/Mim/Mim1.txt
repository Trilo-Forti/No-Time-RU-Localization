I am sorry for the inconvenience but I have to tell you something important.

Who am I? Not important, STOP ASKING QUESTIONS. Alright?

"What happened to the stuff in the box" you ask? I had to confiscate them to preserve the right order of the timeline, and so on 
bla bla bla... I'll spare you the details.

Yours in haste.
