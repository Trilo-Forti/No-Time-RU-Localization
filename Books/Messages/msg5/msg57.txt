"We should pray to the angels, for they are given to us as guardians."

"There is nothing evil save that which perverts the mind and shackles the conscience."
"It is Peter himself that He says, 'You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.' 
Where Peter is, there is the Church. And where the Church, no death is there, but life eternal."
