Quote of St. Hidlegard of Bingen:

"…The visions which I saw I did not perceive in dreams nor when asleep nor 
in a delirium nor with the eyes or ears of the body. I received them when 
I was awake and looking around with a clear mind, with the inner eyes and ears, 
in open places according to the will of God…."
