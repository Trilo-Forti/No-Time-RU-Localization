Even though Cape dun was the first settlement ever, so far east, it did dwindle in the shadow of St. André and its growing infrastructure.

By now St. André is a major metropolis and can be seen against the horizon of Cape Dun's shores.

Yet, Cape Dun is the better sight in my opinion and the nicer tourist attraction. Not being as dingy as the mega city in the west.
