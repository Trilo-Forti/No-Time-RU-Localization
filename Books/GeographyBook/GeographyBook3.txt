
-Pine Island-
Pine Island is composed of a desertous area in the west and a lush green part in the south.
It connects to Root Island in the east via an abandoned bridge. Root Island was originally part of the Manhofer Testing Grounds and therefore it needed a stable connection to the main island, for transports and things alike.

Pine Island is home to Pine Lake, the current capital of the island.
