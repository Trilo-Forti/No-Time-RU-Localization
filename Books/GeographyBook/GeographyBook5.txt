To the south, a massive national reserve presides. It is the original home of the natives, who lived here for hundreds of years before our time here on Pine Island. Their ruins can still be found scattered amongst the southern wilderness. It is a very remote and quiet spot in contrast to the other well visited regions.
To the north is the great reef of Pine Island. A big tourist spot for divers.

Situated in the center of the island, you may find Mount Uroruh. First climbed by Fredich Athor. The original settler of Pine Lake.
