The PLC is made out of several important components!

1. The main CRT display is your way of receiving the devices output!
2. The compass tells you your direction on the horizontal plane!
3. The Radiation meter will start clicking if you are in a radioactive area!
4. Control knobs, use the extendable keyboard to type!
5. This is your time wipe meter. If it flashes a time wipe will ensue! The timeline gets flattened out!
   [Items you left somewhere on Pine Island will get lost, your past selves get erased, major changes will stay however. REMEMBER THIS]
6. The date meter! It translates your current position on the time wave into the current time!
   [It also adjusts its color to blue if your recorded quest is in the current time]
