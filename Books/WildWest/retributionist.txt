I want you to take revenge on Westwood for me. I believe we should start by taking out his cohort, he calls himself THE BANE OF THE WILD WEST RUFFIANS. He is known for disappearing and being seldom seen, though he does live somewhere on Pine Island, it should be not much of an issue to you since you are the best among the great manhunters out here in Acoria. After you got his head, meet me in the high lands of Mount Uroruh in the north, just south of the ruins of Dun Uroh. -James
