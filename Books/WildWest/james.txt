If this message reaches you, this will mean that Miles was unsuccessful and I might be next. I decided to the best of your assasins to take him out clean, if that did not do it I might be next and word of your services is fairly overestimated. Note that if Westwoods new henchling gets me, you will have to spring into action too, lest you will lose your grip on the island. -James
