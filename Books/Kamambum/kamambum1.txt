Our story begins on a singular island with high rocks. Somewhere on the southern sea.
The late heroes son was hid on an island. The boy lived there with his uncle and aunt.
Before that his life consisted of nine years of running from the pirates, which are in league with the horde.
His mondane life continued ten years till he was nineteen. That was when Redbeard came. Redbeard, if you only heard what I did and I found out only little, 
you would have heard of a man of many battles, adventures, mysteries.

At once he appeared during a stormy night at the boys bed: "There is no time for packin we have to go!"
The pirates have figured out where the boy was hiding.
